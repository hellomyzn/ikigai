# ikigai

Collect, archive, and reflect on personal data — from health records to digital footprints — to better understand my "ikigai".

## Overview

**ikigai** is a personal project aimed at gathering various types of personal data such as:
- Health data (e.g., Apple Health, Fitbit)
- Netflix viewing history
- YouTube watch history
- Google search history
- Other digital activity logs

By extracting and organizing these data sources, the project helps to create a mirror of daily life, aiding self-discovery and understanding of what truly matters — *ikigai*.

## Features

- Tools to export and transform personal data into structured formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, Parquet)
- Scripts to automate periodic data extraction
- Data cleaning and normalization pipelines
- Basic visualization templates for analysis
- Documentation on how to access and download data from different services

> 📌 **Note:**  
> This repository contains only **source code**.  
> All extracted personal data is stored separately in a **private repository** for security and privacy reasons.

## Why "ikigai"?

"Ikigai" (生きがい) is a Japanese concept meaning "reason for being."  
Through careful observation of my habits, interests, and behaviors, I hope to gain deeper insight into what drives my joy, growth, and purpose.
